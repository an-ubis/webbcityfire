            <h1>Fire History:</h1>
            <img width="400" src="city-hall-fire-dept.jpg" alt="a guy with a mullett" />
            <p>The first Webb City Fire volunteer fire department was established in 1889 under the leadership of Fire Chief Henry Wonner.
                 Webb City Fire Department became an all-paid department in 1899.
                 This was also the first year the department received their first hose wagon and horses. 
                 In 1910 the citizens of Webb City voted on a bond issue to purchase the first auto fire apparatus and a ladder truck for $10,000.00 
                 Both the auto and the ladder truck were on display at the International Association of Fire Chiefs Convention in Syracuse, New York 
                 prior to their delivery in the late summer and early fall of 1910. 
                 It was state of the art for it’s time with warning bells, headlights, hose reel and fire-fighting equipment. 
                 It came in vermillion red with gold leaf lettering. The Fire Department was housed in various locations until 1975.
                 In 1975 the city purchased land behind the City Hall and built a new Fire Station.
                 The department remained there until 2004 when the old station was replaced by new one at 506 S. Ellis Street.
                 The current station has six drive thru bays and eight individual bedrooms.
                 The station houses Engine one a Ferrara Pumper, two Freightliner Engines, one Ferrara ladder Truck, F-350 Brush Truck,
                 Ford F-150 Battalion Chiefs Truck, and the Chief’s vehicle. The department has a staff of 19 full-time personnel.
                 The department is led by Fire Chief Andrew Roughton and Battalion Chief’s Jackie Clark, Scott Pink, and Jeremy Denton.</p>

            <h1> Insurance Services Organization Rating:</h1>
            <img width="400" src="iso.png" alt="a guy with a mullett" />
            
            <p> The ISO rating is the measuring tool used by Insurance Companies to set rates for Homeowner’s and Businesses based on our fire protection resources.
                 The lower the rating the better the rates. After years of continued support from our City Council, City Management, 
                 Water Department, and Citizens the hard work of our fire department paid off with a notice from ISO that Webb City 
                 would have a Fire rating of Three (3) beginning June 1 2008.
