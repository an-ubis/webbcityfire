        <h1 class="red-text">Fire History:</h1>
        <img width="400" src="city-hall-fire-dept.jpg" alt="a guy with a mullett" />
            <p>The first Webb City Fire volunteer fire department was established in 1889 under the leadership of Fire Chief Henry Wonner.
                <br> Webb City Fire Department became an all-paid department in 1899.
                <br> This was also the first year the department received their first hose wagon and horses. 
                <br> In 1910 the citizens of Webb City voted on a bond issue to purchase the first auto fire apparatus and a ladder truck for $10,000.00 
                <br> Both the auto and the ladder truck were on display at the International Association of Fire Chiefs Convention in Syracuse, New York 
                <br> prior to their delivery in the late summer and early fall of 1910. 
                <br> It was state of the art for it’s time with warning bells, headlights, hose reel and fire-fighting equipment. 
                <br> It came in vermillion red with gold leaf lettering. The Fire Department was housed in various locations until 1975.
                <br> In 1975 the city purchased land behind the City Hall and built a new Fire Station.
                <br> The department remained there until 2004 when the old station was replaced by new one at 506 S. Ellis Street.
                <br> The current station has six drive thru bays and eight individual bedrooms.
                <br> The station houses Engine one a Ferrara Pumper, two Freightliner Engines, one Ferrara ladder Truck, F-350 Brush Truck,
                <br> Ford F-150 Battalion Chiefs Truck, and the Chief’s vehicle. The department has a staff of 19 full-time personnel.
                <br> The department is led by Fire Chief Andrew Roughton and Battalion Chief’s Jackie Clark, Scott Pink, and Jeremy Denton.</p>

                <h1 class="red-text">Insurance Services Organization Rating:</h1>
        <img width="400" src="iso.png" alt="a guy with a mullett" />
            
            <p> The ISO rating is the measuring tool used by Insurance Companies to set rates for Homeowner’s and Businesses based on our fire protection resources.
                <br> The lower the rating the better the rates. After years of continued support from our City Council, City Management, 
                <br> Water Department, and Citizens the hard work of our fire department paid off with a notice from ISO that Webb City 
                <br> would have a Fire rating of Three (3) beginning June 1 2008.
